* 24-Game Solver

** Introduction

The *24-Game* is a simple card game whose goal is to use the basic
arithmetic operators('+', '-', '*', '/') on 4 random integers to get
the final desired result - 24. For more information about the game,
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game .

The solver.py searches for all possible expressions for a given set of
4 integers, without producing duplicates like (3+5+7+9) and (9+7+5+3).
Also, the final expression uses minimum number of parentheses, and is
as concise as possible.

** Sample

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python solver.py
Please insert 4 integers, each within [1,13], separated by space:
3 5 7 9
Solutions:
3+5+7+9 = 24
5*9-3*7 = 24
9*(5-7/3) = 24
(3+9)*(7-5) = 24
